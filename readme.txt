How to use:

1. Download JSON files from the #match-reporting channel for the div you are reporting
2. Download the _latest_ version of the stats spreadsheet for your div
3. Change the settings in settings.cfg to match your week, div and season\
4. Make sure any already reported JSONs are kept in a seperate folder
5. Run the SlapSheet.exe program
6. Copy the output in stats.xslx into the stats spreadsheet
7. Done!

You will still have to manually add players to the sheet. Currently players not on the sheet will be marked as EA on the match report.
Their usernames will include ""- NOT IN SHEET".

If the logs don't have the right amount of periods for either team, it will also display an error on the same row as the match code.
You will have to manually verify that these logs are indeed correct and correct them on the stats sheet.
